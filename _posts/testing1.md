We're going to check if the display math is fixed. 

Here is case one. There are no spaces.

$$
\mu(E) = \mu(E\cap A) + \mu(E\cap A^c)
$$

Ending text 1

Now we're going to check case two, there is one space on top, but no space on the bottom.

$$
\mu(E) \not< \mu(E\cap A) + \mu(E\cap A^c).
$$

Ending text 2

Now we're checking case 3, there is one space on  the bottom only

$$
\mu(E) \not< \mu(E\cap A) + \mu(E\cap A^c).
$$

Ending text 3.

Finally case 4, plenty of space on top and bottom. No need for edits.

$$
\mu(E) \not< \mu(E\cap A) + \mu(E\cap A^c).
$$

Ending text 4.

OK display math is tested. Now we have inline math. Here is $$\mu$$. and $$A$$ and plane-$$x,y$$-plane. we should be fine even if we have money \$ characters. What if I already have some double dollar signs $$4x+2$$? It should correct for it.

That should be all the tests.
